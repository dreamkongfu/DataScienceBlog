A. Bayesian Statistics VS classic statistic
1. treating parameters as random variables
2. credible intervals
3. be improved by Markov Chain Monte Carlo for high-dimensional problems no mater its distributions

B. MCMC Sampling Algorithms
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm assess whether to update a parameter

C. Convergence :
1.use two different starting values to ensure full converge
2.Gelman-Rubin scale reduction factor(SRF)  <=1.2 means convergence

D.choice of prior
1. sensitivity analysis with a range of such priors.
2. off the shelf priors
3.informative subjective priors from experts, historical studies or established evidence
4.meta-analysis to set an informative prior

E. Model comparison 
1.Bayes factor : B12 = P(Y/M1)/P(Y/M2) 
2. asses using posterior model P(Mj/Y), P(Mj/Y) = P(Mj)P(Y/Mj) /sum(P(Mi)P(Y/Mi) i from 1 to T 
3. model averaged estimates
3. generalized linear mixed models

F Bayesian appplication
1.most frequent analytic framework: multivariate analysis and structural equation models(SEMs)
2. Most generally , latent class analysis
3. diagnosis and classification studies(Discriminant Analysis, k-means Analysis)
4 panle and case control studies
5. item response analysis
