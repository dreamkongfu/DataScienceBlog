    2. impact of cost overrun
    3.Capital Infrastructure Program Budgets
    4.Causes of Cost overrun
    5.Program Cost Control Measures
    6.Useful Tools.

    Defining cost : 
        1.Fiscal Cost: costs of "the work",completed items to operate and maintend, adjacent system to upgrade or retool
        2.Political Cost
        3.Social and Economic Cost

    Impacts of cost overrun
        1.Reduced program delivery
        2. Lost investments
        3.Time delays with resulting direct additional cost and asset benefit
        4.Transparency questioned
        5.Social and Economic Opportunity Cost
        6.need to generate more funds - other programs/services impacted
        7.Political Capital

    Capital Infrastructure Program Budgets
        1.long-term and very broad
        2. understated for politial/development purpose
        3.complex modelling that accounts for all factors.
        4.budget is often assembled from various sources.
    Causes of Cost overrun
        1.inaccurate base estimate
        2.unrealistic schedules causing program delay
        3.misplaced decision-making
        4.Inadequate contingency for escalation , unforeseen events
        5.failure to focus on the critical path
        
Tools 
1.Spend curve and Estimate to complete
2.Based on resource-loaded integrated management schedule(IMS)

Track budget:
                budget          actual     variance
revenue item  dep1  dep2     dep1  dep2   dep1  dep2
