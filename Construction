Design Stages:
      Order of Magnitude -> Schematic Design -> Design Development ->Construction Design
      Order of Magnitude  ->  conceptual design -> rough estimate(square floor & unit cost) + cost of contingency
      Schematic Design -> lay out and  interior program -> Architectural,Structural,Mechanical,Electrical,Plumbing,Fire alarm, Item Quantity,Cost,price
      Design Development -> selection department and functional area , pantries, bathroom,private offices ->Architectural(Wall, Floor,Ceiling,Doors(Item Quantity,Cost,price)
      Construction Design -> Specifications&Drawings for construction projects. flooring, walls,ceilings,furnitures MEP systems
      
      Tips :
      The cost of implementing design changes beyond the desin phase can add significant cost impacts to your project.
      Apply contingency to overal price
Estimate: build the project on paper. Then asses quantity
      Conceptual estimate : schematic and budgetary phase
      preliminary estimate : 
      Detailed estimate: 1. break into cost centers 2. estimate quantities 3, estimate prices 4,price * quantities
      Tools:Cost indices,Cost capacity factor ,Component Ratios, Parameter Costs
            Cost indices, a price of a total constant package of resources,typital input: 
                   4 constant package : Lumber,structure steal,cement and labor , constant quantity
                   The index is computed by dividing cost by the cost in a base reference period. Show changes of cost over time
                        e.g productivity , inflation
             Cost capacity factor 
                  applies to changes in size, in scope, or in capacity of projects of similar type.
                   c2 = c1/(Q2/Q1)^x
             Component Ratios
             Parameter Costs
 Pricing: 
             All-in rate: rates database whin your company
                         Rate data base online -RS means , for reference
                         Previous projects/benchmarking
             Include all material, labor,equipment&other associated costs

             Labor component
                    Prices in monetary terms: Hourly wages,fringe benefits,payroll Insurance,taxes,wage premiums
                    Productivity: The amount of work that a worker can accomplish in a defined period of time
                    Prices in monetary terms: 
                      wage: unit labor cost * quantity 
                            difficulty(scope and variety of work ,labor union,labor autonomy,different rates,state laws,taxes,vary by location)
                            location& labor agreement , type of craft,classification , wage at time of work
                      fringe benefits: health insurance, vacation,Pensions,Detal Plas,training,industry advancement
                      Insurance Based on Payroll:Workmen's compensation,public liability,property damage,premium,FICA insurances&most SDIs
                      Taxes based on Payroll: Federal income tax, State income tax, Local taxes(not for estimating)
                      Wage premiums: Overtime work,shift-work differentials, premium for hazardous work
                     Labor Cost Estimate
                        work hours = quantity takoff *productivity rate
                        Total labor cost = work hours* average wage rate
                              Labor cost = Base wage rate(include premium)+Fringe benefits+Taxes+Insurances
                        Table :  Quantity craft hourly wae rate cost/ hour 

Post Contract
        1. Interim valuations and certificates for payments
        2.Cash flow control and forecasts through budgetary control
            adjust the cash flow plan to reflect alterations in the target cost, the master schedule,the forecasted inflation
        3. Financial statements showing current and expected final costs for the project
            review contingency and risk allowances at intervals and reporting the assesments
            regulaly updating and reissuing the cost plan and variation orders causing any alteration
        Action: submit regular up-to date and accurate cost reports to inform current budgetary and cost situation
        S-curve in cost reporting: cumulative project cost plotted against time
                                   used at a desired forecast for cash flow, performance checking ,identify growth,slippage, problems
        Changes of control summary 
        Contingency tracker
        funding tracker
        risk and opportunity register
        Procurement schedules: an action of obtaining or acquiring 
                  Pre Bid Estimate( baseline estimate , perfomed internally )
                  Bid Documents (organize ,realese bid)-> Bid Return& Leveling(analysis all bids, compare) -> Contract Award(final negotiation,award contract)
                  select vendors,strategic vetting selection,establish payment term,contract negotiation,purchasing of goods
      Pre Bid Estimate : understand potential budget that needs to be set aside
                         establish contact with suppliers
                         setting a cost baseline to your project/bechmark
      1.determine funding
      2.update estimate to current design
      3.understand current values
      4.bring team to the procurement stage
