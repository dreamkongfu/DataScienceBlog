 Aalen additive model:
 example: 
 # Fit a model to the lung cancer data set
  lfit <- aareg(Surv(time, status) ~ age + sex + ph.ecog, data=lung,nmin=1)
 cox regression model: cons:its validity relies heavily on assumption of proportional hazards
                            insufficiency in dealing with time-varying covariate effects due to constant regression coefficients
 Akaike's Criterion: Akaike's information criterion(AIC) is best known for goodness-of-fit index(GIF) for conformatory factor
                     witten as X^2 + 2q. X^2 is the maximum likelihood chi-squired statistic and q refers to the freedom of degree
                     for model selection in regression model,Bozdogan refers to as risk of modeling(fitted model vs true model)vs risk of estimation(population estimate vs sample estimate)
                     cons: sensitive to sample size,least sensitive to misspecification error among GIF,little empirical support to justify its application, not recommended to use

 2.aeqSurv:create surv object for tied events
 
 Issue: Tied events are simply when two events occur at the exact same recorded time.
 Solution: This routine is called by both survfit and coxph to deal with the issue of ties that get incorrectly
broken due to floating point imprecision.
return: a Surv object identical to the original, but with ties restored
3.anova.coxph :Analysis of Deviance for a Cox model
4.attrassign: Create new-style "assign" attribute
5.basehaz: Alias for the survfit function
 Compute the predicted survival curve for a Cox model
6.cch: Fits proportional hazards regression model to case-cohort data
   case-cohort data is random sample of the corhort study used as a comparison group for all cases in the cohort
                  issue: too expensive to collect and process covariate information on all study subjects
                  prentice estimator is complex to estimate variance
