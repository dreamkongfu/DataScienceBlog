Decision Making : one of the two critical leadership task
Decision analysis provides a systematic approach to make decisions
Making decision:
Goals 
Options(actions)
dilemma : under uncertainty
          uncertain what will happen if you select a particular action
          choice between: an action leading to a certain outcome, an action leading to an uncertain outcome,both uncertain
Solution: decision tree actions with (expected profit& revenue), probabilities
subjectivity& uncertainty : impossible to be objective and unbiased, no one knows everything

group decision benefits:more information, less biased
Problem: We are attracted to people who are like us(similar) , how we form groups,look for info
Solution: select groups for diversity, think about what consitituencies(info& perspective) need to be represented 

participation problems:
    1.The larger a group , the more diversity of info and perspectives
    hard to get a word in edgewise
    2. people lean spectating
    3. cultures are 'naturally' less participative
Solutions:
    1. break into smaller groups to increase air-time
    2.start meetings by getting everyone talking - even just introducing themselves
          Biggest difference in participation is between 0 and 1;people who start talking will keep talking
    3. Be vigilant about spectators
    4. Be a leader by bring them back into discussion
Influence problem
    1.when we are uncertain, we are easily influenced by others
       we look to others to resolve our uncertainty
    2.It can be difficult to voice public disagreement with the group
        Disagreement is natural and should be expected, since everyone brings something different to the tables
Solution:
    1.get group members to provide info and perspectives before they know what others think 
          try writing before discussing
    2.encourage those who are susceptible to influences (younger, less experienced) to speak first before they know what they think 
    3.Vertical groups
    4.make disagreement more comfortable by legitimating dissent
Diversity is a resource
innovation,creativity,complex thinking& high-quality decision-making
1.differences in experience
2.differences in expertise
3.differences in information
4.differences in perspective
Methods:
  actively solicit different perspectives
  acknowledge,respect and appreciate differences
  validate individuals
